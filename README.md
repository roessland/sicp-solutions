# SICP Solutions in Racket and Golang

My solutions to SICP. All solutions done in Racket and Go (golang) to compare
their differences. Go code will be written with readability and performance in
mind, and won't shy away from using mutable structures if needed, while the
Racket code will be written as functional as possible.
