# SICP Solutions in Scheme and Golang

My solutions to SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs).
All solutions done in Scheme and Go/golang (when
reasonable) to compare their differences. Go code will be written with
readability and performance in mind, and won't shy away from using mutable
structures if needed, while the Scheme code will be written as functional as
possible.

Feel free to copy any code in this repo for any usage.
Give me a ping if you require an actual LICENSE file.
