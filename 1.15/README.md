# SICP Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be
computed by making use of the approximation
$ \sin x \approx x $ if $x$ is sufficiently small,
and the trigonometric identity

$$ \sin x = 3\,\sin\frac x3 - 4\,\sin^3\frac x 3 $$

to reduce the size of the argument of $\sin$. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.)
These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of *a*) used by the process generated by the `sine` procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?

## Answer to a)

Walking through the call stack by hand we see that
`p` is evaluated 5 times.

    (sine 12.15)
        (p (sine (4.05)))
            (p (sine (1.35)))
                (p (sine (0.45)))
                    (p (sine (0.15)))
                        (p (sine (0.05)))
                    ..
                ..
            ...
        ...

## Answer to b)

Growth in space: We need to store the stack down to the lowest level.
To grow from 0.01 to a using multiplications by 3 we need *n* operations where
*n* is defined by $0.01 \cdot 3^n = a$.
Solving for *n* and throwing away some coefficients we find
that $n = O(\log a)$.

Growth in time: Equivalent to growth in space.
No fancy tree recursion here.
$ t = O(\log a) $.
