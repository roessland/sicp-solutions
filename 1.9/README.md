# SICP Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1, and `dec` which decrements its argument by 1.

    (define (+ a b)
        (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
    (define (+ a b)
        (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Using the substitution mode, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

    First: (+ 4 5)
    (if (= 4 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 4) b)))
        (if (= 3 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
            (if (= 2 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 2) 5)))
                (if (= 1 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))
                    (if (= 0 0) 5 ...) = 5
                6
            7
       8 
    9

First method is recursive.

    Second: (+ 4 5)
    (if (= 4 0) 5 (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))))
        (if (= 3 0) 6 (+ (dec 3) (inc 6)))
            (if (= 2 0) 7 (+ (dec 2) (inc 7)))
                (if (= 1 0) 8 (+ (dec 1) (inc 8)))
                    (if (= 0 0) 9)
                    9
Second method is iterative if tail call optimization is enabled.
